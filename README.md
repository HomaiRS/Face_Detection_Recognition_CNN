# MIT face recognition project dataset
In this project, the dataset from “MIT face recognition project” (http://courses.media.mit.edu/2004fall/mas622j/04.projects/faces/) was used for classifying face images using different machine learning algorithms including. The dataset contains face images from different age, race and sex groups makes the classification task more challenging. Also, cumulatively, there are about 400 infant, face aside, too dark, too bright, and blank images in the dataset. Therefore, these images should either be preprocessed or excluded before the classification analysis. 

# Face classification: an evaluation of supervised learning methods

The goal of this repository is to use the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for face detection, facial features extraction and recognition.
